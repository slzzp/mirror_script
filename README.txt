Here are some web page(s)/file(s) mirror or get single file scripts.

NOTICE:
- My develop platform is debian "squeeze", using general /bin/sh and unix tools.
- Remember to check the script then fix external commands' path or filename.
- I use csh/tcsh as my shell, if you're not, please fix something or somewhere about it.
- I put this repository at ~/work/mirror_script , if you're not, please fix something or somewhere about it.
- I always run script at ~/tmp/ , if you're not, please fix something or somewhere about it.
